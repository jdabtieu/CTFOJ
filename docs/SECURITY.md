# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please refer to the chart below for versions with security support

| Version     | Supported          |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Prereleases | :x:                |
| Betas       | :x:                |
| >= 4.3.0    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.3.0     | :x:                |

As you can tell, it is strongly recommended to always be on the latest stable major release. When security issues are uncovered, we will do
our best to promptly release a patched version.

Although CTFOJ works on both Windows and Linux, it is strongly recommended to run the application on a modern Linux distribution with Python 3.8 or higher.

#### Code Style
We encourage you to follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for
Python code, with a modification of 90 characters line length. However, longer lines may be used if
breaking the line would reduce readability.

For non-Python code, please use 4 space tabs, limit your lines to under 100 characters, use
descriptive variable names, and follow general good practices (unless it would reduce readability or performance).
